===============

Half of the Boulder gSchool class commutes to school each day from Denver. The City Council from The People's Republic of Boulder is currently updating it's Transportation Master Plan and needs stats. These stats will be derived from both the students from Denver and those that come from Boulder. Fortunately, you work for gSchool, Inc. and are involved in the Big Data space.

Your mission, if you choose to accept it is to provide key statistics derived from data provided by gSchool students.
